# Code Sample

Python Code Sample to showcase programming knowledge for job a interview.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Python Version
```
python 3.6.8
```

I have a requirements.txt to install dependencies needed
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

Download repository and activate venv
```
source venv/bin/actiavte
```

Builds are in target/dist/
Run main.py

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

I use pybuilder to build and test my project.

In the project root directory run 
```
pyb
```
This will build and run test cases for the files in the project and output pass/fail.


### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
